# Housing Price Prediction

## Description
A machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features and parameters. This project uses regression techniques to estimate house prices accurately.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Price prediction functionality

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib/seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-price-prediction.git
cd housing-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the `data` folder
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```python
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```python
   python src/train.py
   ```
4. Make predictions:
   ```python
   python src/predict.py
   ```
